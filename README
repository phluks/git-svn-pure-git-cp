!!!WARNING!!!
This script has not been tested extensively. It will not break anything,
but it may make a bit of a mess.

If it does not complete you will have a <taget>.tmp dir and/or a 
<target>.dir. You can try debug for yourself or just delete the 2 dirs
with rm -rf <dir>.

ABOUT git-svn-pure-cp
---------------------
This is a simple script meant to make a copy of a git repository
created with the git-svn suite to a fully functional ordinary git 
repository in a subdir of PWD.

This means, that you can make ordinary git clones from the copy. However,
the pure git repo knows nothing of the original svn repo and will not be
able to interoperate with it. Its a clean cut.

The amount of the original svn history of the copy is entirely up to the 
amount imported into the svn-git repo. All of the history of the svn-git
repo should be imported (please review the script and the result).

The script is essentially a subset of git-svn-migrate.


USAGE
-----
git-svn-pure-cp <path-to-git-svn-repo> <name-of-copy>


USE CASE
--------
For most ordinary exports of svn repos with standard layout, you would be
much better off using a tool like git-svn-migrate.

If you already have a git-svn repo, or you for some reason need to make 
your own svn-to-git export, git-svn-pure-git-cp enables you to "upgrade"
your resulting svn export repo to a pure git repo.

REQUIREMENTS
------------
Reasonably recent version of git (Im not quite sure which version).
Shell invironment - like bash.

The script makes an intermediary copy of the git-svn repo in PWD (present-
working-directory). So you must have at least 2 times the diskspace of the 
original repo available. You must be able to read the original repos and be
able to write to PWD.
